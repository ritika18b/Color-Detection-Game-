# Color Game

This is a simple color game built using Python and the Tkinter library. The game challenges players to type the color of the text displayed on the screen, not the word itself. The game keeps track of the player's score and time, and players can view a leaderboard after the game ends.

## How to Play

1. The game starts with a 30-second timer.
2. A color name appears on the screen, but the text color may not match the name.
3. Your task is to type the color of the text (not the word) into the entry box and press Enter.
4. Each correct answer increases your score by 1.
5. The game ends when the time runs out.
6. After the game ends, you can enter your name and submit your score.
7. Press the Spacebar to view the leaderboard with all saved scores.
